The project's goal is to delve into sales data, identifying patterns, trends, and areas for improvement or optimization. The dataset contains sales information like dates, product IDs, categories, quantities, and amounts across a specific timeframe. Analysis steps involve data cleaning (managing missing values, eliminating duplicates, ensuring data integrity), descriptive statistics (calculating mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and frequency counts), and data visualization (using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and optionally Plotly for dynamic visualizations). Additionally, the project includes feature engineering (creating new features, transforming variables), correlation analysis (exploring relationships between variables), and outlier detection (spotting and addressing outliers). Essential Python libraries for this analysis include NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and optionally, Plotly for interactive charts.
